**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Including ethical and inequity components I believe there are few components to consider like transparency and accountability in making decisions; additional strengths should be done on data privacy and protection and include the best international standards like ISO 27001, ITIL4 and etc; essential here might be using AI and automation in order to prevent unwanted outcomes.

From inequity components I would consider the equal access to education and upskilling employees, cross-functioning cooperation and promoting safe, productive and development workspace for everyone. 

To monitor all above I would like to highlight importance of regular audits and surveys, developing training programs and create the work environment where everyonesâ€™ voice would be heard  and consider in decisio-making processes
